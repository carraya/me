    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
      When I was in first grade, my dad drove me to a high school robotics
      competition 30 minutes away. My mom is the one who made it happen--she
      insisted on it, even though neither of them knew anyone there or what was
      going on. We sat on the bleachers and watched for hours. Then we left.
    </p>

    <p>
      I don't remember much about the event. I don't even remember feeling
      particularly interested. I do know it was unlike anything I had seen
      before--and something that I wouldn't have seen if it weren't for the
      <b>purposeful exposure</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fast forward to my senior year of high school, when I was standing in the
      middle of a stadium where my team lost the world championship semi-finals
      of that same robotics league. That's the first time I recalled that
      coincidental trip my mom made me go on when I was 7 years old.
    </p>

    <p>
      My life has been shaped by <b>seeds planted by others</b>--seeds that grew
      into a forest of opportunities, nurtured by those who believed in me.
      Moments of <b>exposure, curiosity, and discomfort</b>--often small and
      fleeting--later sprouted into something much larger. These experiences
      shaped the way I approach every choice I make today.
    </p>

    <p>
      If my mom planted the first tree, it was my dad that watered it. Watching
      him work two jobs, often from early mornings until late nights, taught me
      the value of <b>persistence</b> and the lengths one must go to
      <b>create opportunity</b>. Growing up Latino in Woodbridge but exposed to
      opportunities and communities beyond it, I became acutely aware of the
      challenges that came with being part of a working-class, first-generation
      family. These early experiences, paired with the guidance of mentors and
      my own curiosity, shaped how I see the world:
      <b
        >as a set of systems that can be questioned, understood, and improved
        through deliberate effort</b
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the story of how those seeds grew, how they withstood storms, and
      how they've shaped the direction I'm headed now. It's a story about the
      <b
        >pursuit of knowledge, annoying persistence, and playing the long
        game</b
      >.
